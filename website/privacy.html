    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2025</p>

    <p>Bible Plus ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Profile Information You Provide:</strong> During onboarding, you optionally share your first name, faith level, life seasons, heart burdens, and preferred Bible translation. This information is stored locally on your device and is used solely to personalize your experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> Messages you send to the AI companion are stored locally on your device and transmitted to our server to generate responses. We do not store your messages on our servers after the response is generated.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We track minimal usage counts locally on your device (e.g., messages sent per week, chapters played per day) for the sole purpose of enforcing free tier limits. This data is not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Your profile data is used on-device to tailor daily content, prayers, and devotionals to your spiritual journey.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Responses:</strong> Your chat messages and profile context are sent to our server, which forwards them to OpenAI's API to generate Scripture-based responses. No personally identifiable information beyond your first name is included.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Generation:</strong> Bible chapter text is sent to our server for text-to-speech conversion. No personal data is included in these requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> We use OpenAI's API (via a secure server proxy) for AI chat responses and text-to-speech audio generation. OpenAI's data usage policy applies to data processed through their API. OpenAI does not use data submitted via API for training purposes. See <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> We use Supabase as our secure server proxy. No personal data is stored on Supabase servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Subscription purchases and management are handled by Apple. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Bolls.life:</strong> We use the Bolls.life API to fetch Bible verse text. Only book, chapter, and translation identifiers are sent; no personal data is included.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All personal data (profile, favorites, collections, chat history) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not maintain user accounts or cloud databases containing your personal information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above, strictly for the purpose of providing app functionality.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at any time by deleting the app. Chat messages sent to generate AI responses are not retained on our servers after the response is delivered.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Bible Plus does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The app's content is suitable for all ages, but subscription purchases require a parent or guardian's Apple ID.</p>

    <h2>8. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Bible Plus does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics SDKs, advertising trackers, or third-party analytics services. We do not track your behavior across apps or websites. The app's App Tracking Transparency status is set to "does not track."</p>

    <h2>9. Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you opt in to notifications, the app schedules local notifications on your device based on your selected prayer times. No data is sent to external push notification services. You can disable notifications at any time in your device's Settings.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> Since all data is on-device, you have full control. Delete the app to remove all data.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can skip personalization during onboarding and use the app with default settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> For any privacy-related questions, email us at <a href="mailto:support@bibleplus.io">support@bibleplus.io</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Bible Plus offers auto-renewable subscriptions (Weekly and Yearly plans) through the Apple App Store. Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy within the app. Your continued use of Bible Plus after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
