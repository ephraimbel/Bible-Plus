I may never understand on this side of eternity, and I bring that frustration honestly to You.\n\nBut even here, I choose to remember: You are close to the brokenhearted.

Thank You that love this deep is evidence of something beautiful, not something wasted.\n\nHold me together today. Give me permission to grieve and the strength to keep going. One foot in front of the other, carried by Your grace.\n\nI place my loved one in Your eternal hands. I trust Your heart even when I cannot trace Your plan. In Jesus' name, amen.",
