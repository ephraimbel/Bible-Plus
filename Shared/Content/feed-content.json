You know every word spoken in anger and every silence that has grown too long.\n\nI confess my part. Where I have been proud, soften me. Where I have been selfish, open my eyes. Where I have withheld forgiveness, remind me how much I have been forgiven.\n\nThank You for the relationships that have shaped me, even the painful ones. Thank You for the person I'm becoming through the friction.\n\nI ask for healing where there is hurt. I ask for courage to have the conversation I've been avoiding. I ask for wisdom to know what to hold on to and what to release.\n\nI surrender my need to be right. Replace it with a desire to be loving. Restore what the locusts have eaten. In Jesus' name, amen.",
